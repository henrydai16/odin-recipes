    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Mie-goreng noodles! </li>
        <ul>
            <li> Yes it must be the iconic Mie-goreng brand. </li>
        </ul>
        <li> Eggs </li>

    <h2> Let's get started! </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> First you're going to want to boil the water. </li>
        <li> Once the water is boiled, place the noodles in (I use two packets) </li>
        <li> Cook the noodles to your liking, then use a strainer and get the noodles to be dry, place in a bowl. </li>
            <ul>
                <li> Some people like their noodles chewy! It's all up to preference. </li>
            </ul>
        <li> Put in the seasoning packets, how much you put in is up to you. </li>
        <li> Fry up an egg, place it on top of the noodles, and <em> voila! </em> </li>
